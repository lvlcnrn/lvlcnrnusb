# lvlcnrnusb
This is the source code for the Level of Concern USB Game. 
I'm a fan and decided to upload it so we can try to decipher the backend and see if we can figure out solutions for the codes.

Things to Note on the Formatted Code:
- Line 4240: t.CACHE_KEY = "top_loc_usb_unlocked_urls",
- Line 13856: t.SUBMIT_CACHE_KEY = "top_loc_usb_submit",

Unlocked URLS enter your Local Storage, perhaps there's a way to retrieve the future urls.
